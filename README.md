## IMPORTANT
This is an early iteration of Durable Functions and does not yet have the quality of a proper public preview. The current bits should be considered "evaluation" quality intended primarily to gather early feedback. Bugs, performance issues, poor monitoring, and breaking changes should be expected until it gets into a "Beta" status. That said, if you run into issues or have ideas for improvements, now is a great time to provide feedback in the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/issues) list.
