## Durable Functions

**Durable Functions** is an extension of [Azure Functions](https://functions.azure.com) and [Azure WebJobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/web-sites-create-web-jobs) that allows writing *long-running*, *stateful* function orchestrations in code in a serverless environment.

This extension enables a new type of function called the *orchestrator function* that allows you to do several new things that differentiates it from an ordinary, stateless function:
* They are stateful workflows **authored in code**. No JSON schemas or designers.
* They can *synchronously* and *asynchronously* **call other functions** and **save output to local variables**.
* They **automatically checkpoint** their progress whenever the function awaits so that local state is never lost if the process recycles or the VM reboots.

The Durable Functions extension currently ships as the [Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask) NuGet package that can be referenced by an Azure Functions Visual Studio project. The project is currently in a public preview "beta" status.
