# JavaScript samples

This project contains samples using JavaScript.

## Building the sample

There is no build step for this sample. However, the required extensions need to be installed. Use the following command to install the extensions used by this sample app.

```bash
func extensions install
```

## Running the sample locally

After a successful build, use the following command to start the function app.

```bash
func host start
```

## Running an orchestration

Use the following cURL command to start a new orchestration:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:7071/orchestrators/E1_HelloSequence -H "Content-Length: 0"
```

The response should contain a JSON payload with several URLs. The following is an example of what the response may look like (formatted for readability):

```json
{
  "id": "36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0",
  "statusQueryGetUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0?taskHub=SampleHubCsx&connection=Storage&code=1sGdXsmh9c1Yglp9ihYRzqRwx7cbbhrfdig2qKAd9v9Ju1gaacUuFg==",
  "sendEventPostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0/raiseEvent/{eventName}?taskHub=SampleHubCsx&connection=Storage&code=1sGdXsmh9c1Yglp9ihYRzqRwx7cbbhrfdig2qKAd9v9Ju1gaacUuFg==",
  "terminatePostUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0/terminate?reason={text}&taskHub=SampleHubCsx&connection=Storage&code=1sGdXsmh9c1Yglp9ihYRzqRwx7cbbhrfdig2qKAd9v9Ju1gaacUuFg==",
  "purgeHistoryDeleteUri": "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0?taskHub=SampleHubCsx&connection=Storage&code=1sGdXsmh9c1Yglp9ihYRzqRwx7cbbhrfdig2qKAd9v9Ju1gaacUuFg=="
}
```

The response should also contain a `Location` header. The value of this header is a URL, which is the same URL as the `statusQueryGetUri`. Use curl again to query this URL to get the orchestration status. The actual URL will be different for every orchestration instance. The following example shows what this will look like:

```bash
curl -i "http://localhost:7071/runtime/webhooks/durabletask/instances/36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0?taskHub=SampleHubCsx&connection=Storage&code=1sGdXsmh9c1Yglp9ihYRzqRwx7cbbhrfdig2qKAd9v9Ju1gaacUuFg=="
```

The JSON response will look something like the following (formatted for readability):

```JSON
{
  "name": "E1_HelloSequence",
  "instanceId": "36a1d82fb9064275b1df810b5962d4e0",
  "runtimeStatus": "Completed",
  "input": null,
  "customStatus": null,
  "output": [
    "Hello Tokyo!",
    "Hello Seattle!",
    "Hello London!"
  ],
  "createdTime": "2019-12-18T19:02:42Z",
  "lastUpdatedTime": "2019-12-18T19:02:42Z"
}
```
