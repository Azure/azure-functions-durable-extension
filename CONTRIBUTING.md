# Contributor Onboarding

## General

 - The goal of this guide is to help you start contributing to Durable Functions

## Pre-reqs

 - OS
    - Windows 10 (suggested)
 - Language runtimes
    - .NET Core 2.0
 - Editor
    - Visual Studio 2017 (recommended)
 - Misc tools (suggested)
    - [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-use-emulator) or real Azure Storage Account


## Change flow

The general flow for making a change to the script host is:
1. 🍴 Fork the repo (add the fork via `git remote add me <clone url here>`
2. 🌳 Create a branch for your change (generally use dev) (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. 🛠 Make your change
4. ✔️ Test your changes
5. ⬆️ Push your changes to your fork (`git push me my-change`)
6. 💌 Open a PR to the dev branch
7. 📢 Address feedback and make sure tests pass (yes even if it's an "unrelated" test failure)
8. 📦 [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your changes into a meaningful commits (`git rebase -i HEAD~N` where `N` is commits you want to squash)
9. :shipit: Rebase and merge (This will be done for you if you don't have contributor access)
10. ✂️ Delete your branch (optional)


## Running the tests (Visual Studio) 

1. Build the project and Visual Studio will identify all the tests in the solution.
2. Set an environment variable named **AzureWebJobsStorage** set to a connection string e.g. to the storage emulator (`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`).
3. Run Azure Storage Emulator 5.6.
4. Run the unit tests via Visual Studio Test Explorer by selecting "Run All"


## Testing code changes locally (Visual Studio) 

Durable Functions are distributed as a NuGet package. So in order to test your changes, you need to integrate it in a function. For that you need the following steps:

1. Create a local NuGet source on your dev machine - e.g. C:\LocalNuGet.
2. Then add the local NuGet source as a NuGet package source in Visual Studio. 
3. Modify the code.
4. Build the project and this will create a new NuGet package with your changes.
5. Add the newly built Durable Functions NuGet package to the local NuGet source. The command to add packages to this location is nuget **add package.nupkg -Source C:\LocalNuGet** .
5. Update your local NuGet cache (**%USERPROFILE%\\.nuget\packages**) with the newest version of the Durable Functions NuGet package.
6. In Visual Studio, add the new NuGet package from your local NuGet source to a function. 
7. Run Azure Storage Emulator with version 5.6 or higher.
8. Run the function and debug.
