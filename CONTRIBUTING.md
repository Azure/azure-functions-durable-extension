# Contributor Onboarding

## General

 - The goal of this guide is to help you start contributing to Durable Functions

## Pre-reqs

 - OS
    - Windows 10 or later (suggested)
 - Language runtimes
    - [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) (version **10.0.102** or later, as specified in [`global.json`](./global.json))
    - The .NET 10 SDK is required because the project multi-targets `net8.0` and `net10.0`. The .NET 10 SDK can build for all earlier target frameworks, but the .NET 8 SDK cannot build `net10.0` targets.
    - The `rollForward` policy in `global.json` is set to `latestFeature`, so any 10.0.1xx SDK version will work
    - You can verify your installed SDK version by running `dotnet --version`
 - Editor
    - Visual Studio 2022 (recommended) or Visual Studio Code
 - Misc tools (suggested)
    - [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) or real Azure Storage Account


## Change flow

The general flow for making a change to the script host is:
1. 🍴 Fork the repo (add the fork via `git remote add me <clone url here>`
2. 🌳 Create a branch for your change (generally use dev) (`git checkout -b my-change`)
3. 🛠 Make your change
4. ✔️ Test your changes
5. ⬆️ Push your changes to your fork (`git push me my-change`)
6. 💌 Open a PR to the dev branch
7. 📢 Address feedback and make sure tests pass (yes even if it's an "unrelated" test failure)
8. 📦 [Rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) your changes into a meaningful commits (`git rebase -i HEAD~N` where `N` is commits you want to squash)
9. :shipit: Rebase and merge (This will be done for you if you don't have contributor access)
10. ✂️ Delete your branch (optional)


## Running the tests (Visual Studio) 

1. Build the project and Visual Studio will identify all the tests in the solution.
2. Set an environment variable named **AzureWebJobsStorage** set to an Azure General Purpose Storage Account connection string.
> Note: While it is possible to use the local storage emulator (`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`), this is not recommended as performance and reliability are severely impacted while running unit tests; using a real storage account in Azure will yield much better results.

3. Run the unit tests via Visual Studio Test Explorer by selecting "Run All"

## Writing tests
All tests for Durable Functions are found in [test/Common](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/dev/test/Common). These tests are written using the [XUnit framework](https://xunit.github.io/). 

NOTE: In order to run any tests you write in our CI pipeline, the test must have one of the following attributes:

 - `[Trait("Category", PlatformSpecificHelpers.TestCategory)]`
 - `[Trait("Category", PlatformSpecificHelpers.TestCategory + "_BVT")]`
 - `[Trait("Category", PlatformSpecificHelpers.FlakeyTestCategory)]`
 
Please avoid writing flakey tests.

## Testing code changes locally (Visual Studio) 

Durable Functions are distributed as a NuGet package. So in order to test your changes, you need to integrate it in a function. For that you need the following steps:

1. Create a local NuGet source on your dev machine - e.g. C:\LocalNuGet.
2. Then add the local NuGet source as a NuGet package source in Visual Studio. 
3. Modify the code.
4. Build the project and this will create a new NuGet package with your changes.
5. Add the newly built Durable Functions NuGet package to the local NuGet source. The command to add packages to this location is nuget **add package.nupkg -Source C:\LocalNuGet** .
5. Update your local NuGet cache (**%USERPROFILE%\\.nuget\packages**) with the newest version of the Durable Functions NuGet package.
6. In Visual Studio, add the new NuGet package from your local NuGet source to a function. 
7. Run Azure Storage Emulator with version 5.6 or higher.
8. Run the function and debug.
